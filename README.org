* Boot to Emacs (B2E)

Boot to Emacs aims to create a complete, standalone operating system
for open computer.

Inspired from [[https://github.com/andreasgal/B2G/][Mozilla's B2G]] we build a standalone operating system
booting directly to another operating system, [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].
